				<strong>A TALE OF A STORY</strong>
				</center> 	
			<br>
			The Thinking Hat is an amazing and solitary creature, with a beautiful  soul. He keeps to himself, is very analytical, and try to avoid being around  those toxic monsters that exist in this world. He loves math, science, and  engineering, but can't stand talking about himself; as he prefers to let his action do his talking for him.  
			<br>
			<br>	
			The hat's  core values are: Integrity, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All He  Does.  The hat goal is to live a peaceful life as much as possible, but understand when things go arise the hat won't  hesitate to stand up for what is true and factual in this world.  Being a hat that thinks, it's no surprise  that he is able to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of things around him, as  well as being able to see those things near and far at the same time. 
			<br>
			<br>	
			These qualities allow him to see far into future and plan accordantly, as illustrated  by the following.  Take the outcome of  this website, it can truly be said that, he knows what he knows, knows what he doesn't know, doesn't know what he knows, and certainly doesn't know what he  doesn't know.  Being the hat that he is, this website is a direct reflection of that,  both from an output perspective, but also from a planning and  managing standpoint.  That is why before  signing up for this course, the hat knew enough to know that things needed to change in his life and growth needed to occur within him, or risk failing  himself and fading into world to be lost in the sea of planets and movement.
