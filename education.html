			<strong>The KNOWLEDGE OVER THE YEARS</strong>
			</center> 
			<br>	
		     I think it is fair to say the hat's education is both vast and limited in nature, all at the same time. Education has always been a staple of the hat's existence, and without it, he wouldn't be the hat he is today, bright and brilliant at times.<br>
			<br>
			Having said that though, somedays, from a money perspective, it feels like he throwing money down a black hole, always there to suck it up, with very little to nothing to show for it. Other perspective like education, it feels like it goes in one ear and out the other at the speed of light with no stopping in between. While from a retention perspective, time is the killer of all things.  They say if you don't use it, you lose it, and it seems like as soon as the hat reaches critical mass, he starts to lose it to void of space before he can actually travel to stars above. <br>
			<br>	
			These three players in totality, are a lot of the reasons why the hat is a lifelong student.  Who doesn't mind taking classes over and over again, whether he passes or fails, whether he needs to or not, least of all whether it's for the first time or not.  Because at the end of the day, education is the life. There is living  life and living life up to its fullest. The life blood of this world and this universe as a whole is about learning, growing,  exploring, and unlock the depths of our own minds.
