				<strong>WELECOME TO THE THINKING HAT'S WEBSITE!!!</strong>
				</center> 
				<br>
				 A composition and composite of webpages, education, and a single semester's worth of HTML experience.<br>	
				<br>	
				<br>	
				<strong>The purpose of this website is to accomplish three primary objectives:</strong><br>
				<div class="indentspace">	
				1.) To show to the world my basic website that I was able to create.
				</div>	
				<br>	
				<div class="indentspace">	
				2.) To complete my assignment requirements for this course.
				</div>	
				<br>
				<div class="indentspace">	
				3.) To show off my current skills and ability as well as to provide motivation   for others to see the potential in me to design something from nothing, possibly for them.
				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>The site is principally design to support two major calling:</strong><br>
				<div class="indentspace">		
				1.) From an educational standpoint, is to meant to demonstrate   what some of the basic html concepts look when its applied in practice.
				</div>	
				<br>
				<div class="indentspace">		
				2.) To provide ideas and inspiration for those needing to create a webpage or website for themselves in a future project.    	
				</div>
				<br> 
				<div class="indentspace">		
				<strong>Note:</strong> If nothing else, and all else fails, and my reason or reasons for what might bring someone to my website isn't good enough for those who find my website, and end up sticking around, know this, I did it because I wanted to and it was fun to be create something by myself from scratch. Think of it, a few days ago, this didn't exist and now it does and for the viewing pleasure of all who come across it. In a universe of infinite possibilities and opportunities to exist and interact with things around us, itâ€™s a pretty amazing feeling to know that has a chance of happen were before it could never be.
